# shape-game
Simple game made with Pixi.js, HTML and CSS that generates random preset shapes with the option to change the number, the falling speed and also a counter of the current displayed shapes. Clicking on a shape deletes it and updates the counter, also when clicking inside the canvas it spawns a random irregular shape. Outline of the shapes is visible when the shape is outside of the canvas.
